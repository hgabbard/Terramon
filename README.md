# Terramon
 an online low-latency earthquake monitoring webpage, utilizing Michael Coughlin's seismon code, that is now available for use.  The site refreshes once every 5 minutes to get the most recent data and then calculates the P/S wave arrival times at each site (llo, lho, geo, virgo), amplitude (velocity induced on accelerometers), source magnitude, source time, distance, and lat/lon. The webpage can also be used as an early warning system and indicates the likelihood of appreciable seismic disturbance at each observatory. This is determined by a set threshold amplitude using previous studies done by Michael Coughlin over initial LIGO data.
